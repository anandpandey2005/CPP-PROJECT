Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and right child.

-------------------------------
Types of Binary Trees
-------

-------> Full Binary Tree

->Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
->No node has only one child.

-------> Complete Binary Tree

->All levels are completely filled, except possibly the last.
->In the last level, all nodes are as far left as possible.

-------> Perfect Binary Tree

->All internal nodes have 2 children.
->All leaf nodes are at the same level.

--------> Balanced Binary Tree

->The difference in height between the left and right subtrees of every node is no more than 1.
->Overall height of the tree is O(log N) where N is the number of nodes.

-------> Degenerate (Skewed) Tree

->Every parent node has only one child.
->It behaves like a linked list.

Two types:

->Left Skewed (only left child exists)
->Right Skewed (only right child exists)
