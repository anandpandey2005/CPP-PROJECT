C++ Status Contributions
"Crafting efficient solutions with C++ ‚Äì where logic meets creativity to build systems that power the future!"
Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of C++ projects I‚Äôve built to explore and demonstrate my skills in programming, system design, and problem-solving. From a classic Tic Tac Toe game to a Hotel Management System, each project showcases my ability to write clean, efficient, and functional code in C++. Dive in to explore the projects, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback!

Projects Overview üßë‚Äçüíª

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
 
1. Tic Tac Toe Game 
A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented entirely in C++, designed to run via command-line arguments.  
How to Run: Since this is a command-line application, you‚Äôll need to either:
Clone the repository and run it on your local machine.

Use a sandbox environment (e.g., an online C++ compiler) to test the game.

Features:
Fully functional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.

Player vs Player gameplay.

Command-line interface for a lightweight experience.

Note: There‚Äôs no graphical interface; the game runs purely on the terminal.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

2. Hotel Management System 
A Hotel Management System implemented in C++, designed to provide a better understanding of how embedded systems and software work together behind the scenes.  
Purpose: This project demonstrates the core logic of managing hotel operations, such as room bookings, check-ins, and check-outs.

How It Works:
Built entirely in C++ with a focus on backend logic.

No graphical interface ‚Äì the system operates via the command line.

Learning Outcome: Gain insights into how software can interact with embedded systems in real-world applications like hotel management.

Note: No preview is available as this is a terminal-based application.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

3. Browser Navigator 
A conceptual project implemented in C++ to simulate browser navigation logic.  
Purpose: This project was created to understand and implement the logic behind browser navigation (e.g., forward/backward navigation, history tracking).

Implementation:
Built using C++ with a focus on data structures and algorithms.

Command-line based, with no graphical interface.

Note: No visual preview is available; the project is meant to demonstrate the underlying logic.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

4. STL (Standard Template Library) Notes 
A folder containing my personal notes on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).  
What‚Äôs Inside:
Notes I wrote while learning STL for the first time.

Examples of STL components like vectors, maps, and algorithms.

Why It‚Äôs Here: These notes reflect my journey of mastering STL, and I now have a strong command over it. They might be helpful for anyone learning STL from scratch.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

5. Registration & Login System 
A simple Registration and Login system implemented in C++.  
Purpose: Demonstrates the working of a basic authentication system, such as a login and registration form.

Implementation:
Built using C++ with a focus on data handling and user input.

Command-line based, with no graphical interface.

Note: No visual preview is available; the project showcases the backend logic of user authentication.

 How to Get Started
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/anandpandey2005/tic-tac-toe-game-use-language-cpp.git

Navigate to the Project Folder:
Each project is organized in its own folder (e.g., TIC TAC TOE, HotelManagementSystem).

Compile and Run:
Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code.

Example for Tic Tac Toe:
bash

g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe

Alternative: Use an online C++ sandbox (e.g., Replit, OnlineGDB) to test the code without setting up a local environment.

 Technologies Used
Language: C++  

Tools: Command-line interface, C++ Standard Template Library (STL)  

Environment: Terminal-based applications

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Why This Repository ‚ùì
This repository is a reflection of my journey in mastering C++ and understanding how software systems work. Each project, whether it‚Äôs a game like Tic Tac Toe or a system like Hotel Management, showcases my ability to:
Write clean and efficient code.

Understand and implement system design concepts.

Work with data structures and algorithms (e.g., STL).

Build projects that mimic real-world applications.

======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Future Improvements üîÆ
Add graphical interfaces (e.g., using SFML or Qt) for projects like Tic Tac Toe and Hotel Management System.

Enhance the Registration/Login system with file-based storage for user data.

Expand the Browser Navigator project to include more features like tab management.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
